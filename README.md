Hi there,

this is the official FT8RX support page.

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/wITTus/ft8rx.github.io/issues) to discuss any kind of problem, bug or feature request regarding the app.

In case you don't know about the app, and you just found it on GitHub you can get it in the [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swi.ft8dx) for a couple bucks.

If you're having problems decoding signals using FT8RX please read the [troubleshooting guide](https://wittus.github.io/ft8rx.github.io/TROUBLESHOOTING).

73, Sascha
